    """Compute the Local Inverse Simpson Index (LISI) for each column in metadata.

    LISI is a statistic computed for each item (row) in the data matrix X.

    The following example may help to interpret the LISI values.

    Suppose one of the columns in metadata is a categorical variable with 3 categories.

        - If LISI is approximately equal to 3 for an item in the data matrix,
          that means that the item is surrounded by neighbors from all 3
          categories.

        - If LISI is approximately equal to 1, then the item is surrounded by
          neighbors from 1 category.
    
    The LISI statistic is useful to evaluate whether multiple datasets are
    well-integrated by algorithms such as Harmony [1].
