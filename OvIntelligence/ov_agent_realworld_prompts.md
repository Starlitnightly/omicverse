# ov.Agent Real-World Prompt Library

Use these scenario-driven prompts to ask `ov.Agent` to reproduce or adapt the workflows that mirror each tutorial notebook in `omicverse_guide/docs`. The prompt text intentionally avoids naming notebook files so it can be dropped directly into an ov.Agent conversation.
